## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate MQTT messaging with a Next.js application. It is automatically synced with your [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) deployments, ensuring your codebase stays up to date with your deployed app.

## Features

- Real-time MQTT messaging in a Next.js environment
- Automatic deployment and syncing via [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
- Hosted on Vercel for seamless CI/CD

## Live Demo

Check out the live deployment:

**[https://vercel.com/andareomondis-projects/v0-next-js-mqtt-integration-8m](https://vercel.com/andareomondis-projects/v0-next-js-mqtt-integration-8m)**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andareomondis-projects/v0-next-js-mqtt-integration-8m.git
    cd v0-next-js-mqtt-integration-8m
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure MQTT:**
    - Update your MQTT broker settings in the appropriate config file or environment variables.

4. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.**

## How It Works

1. Build and modify your project using [v0.dev](https://v0.dev).
2. Deploy your changes from the v0 interface.
3. Updates are automatically pushed to this repository.
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from the repository.
